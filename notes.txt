Big Picture:
-How to test channels? 

Root Page
  -What if someone loses their session or cookies somehow? There should be a login method by name

Host Page 
  -Game timer
  -Initial Styling
  -All the HRN conversations are being added by the JS as "HRN" instead of who they're too

Player Page
  -When a player leaves
    -Sending a message to their conversation partners - "#{number} has disconnected"
    -Giving the player themselves their fate
    -Preventing a player who's left from sending any messages
      -(You can send messages to players who've left. That's poigent, yo)
  -Like... any security
  -When game starts, a "Connected!" message that disappears after a little bit
  -New conversations aren't being added to the conversation list by the JS

Conversation Page
  -Host should have two rows of notifications
    -Split screen?
  -Scroll down to the bottom on page load, when a message is sent
  -The back button in the header should return to the game when the player's the host
  -Styling links so they're actually visible, instead of blue on blue

TO ASK ALEX
-I'm giving each of the players a five number code - that good? Should it be more like a phone number, 10 digits?
-Does the host need or want the ability to read everyone's messages?
-Should I restrict the host's ability to talk to people without getting their numbers?
-Do we want to save the messages for later review?

Styling

Player Page:
  -Styling should be dark background/light text - people are going to be reading this in the dark
  -Disconnected, during post game
