TO ASK ALEX
-I'm giving each of the players a five number code - that good? Should it be more like a phone number, 10 digits?
-Does the host need or want the ability to read everyone's messages?
-Should I restrict the host's ability to talk to people without getting their numbers?
-Do we want to save the messages for later review?
