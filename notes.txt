Big Picture:
-Back button problem
-Mark phone numbers

Big Styling Overhaul
-Maybe make the cut-off for the mobile styling a little smaller
-The link text is different in from messages vs too messages, which bothers me. It should be consistent, lest the players read into it
-There's a lot of empty space at the bottom of the conversation screen. should probably do something about that
-When game starts, a "Connected!" message that disappears after a little bit
-"Return to Front Page" link when game's over on game, player maybe?
-Order of conversations - I'd like HRN to be on top all the time. Or at the very least, for it to be consistent
-Weird inconsistency with text size
  On the phone, if there are any messages longer than 10 characters, all of the messages will appear in a larger font
  Triggers the effect: '12345678901', '12345 7890' 'the the the the'
  Doesn't: 'it's very weird', 'the the the'
  See if I can replicate it locally, ideally in the browser
-If the chat box is shorter than it's maximum size, when the keyboard comes up you can't see the bottom of the chat window

DOING IT PROPERLY
-Optimizing the database requests
-Upping the Accessibility
-Test performance generally
-What kind of backend am I using to run the jobs?
-Firefox seems finicky with channels
  -I can build this with ajax calls. But I'd have to 1. do it and 2. detect the failure to connect to the channel and switch over to ajax styles
-Convert to vanilla javascript
-100% test coverage

-Tests for channels
  -It does appear there are testing utilities for channels. Not sure if there's much in the way of documentation though
-Javascript testing
  -So far, this is a nightmare. System testings are intended to simulate running through the system as on a browser, javascript and all
  -But I can't figure out how to get it to wait for things to happen. I'm looking at events which are triggered by server, with no input from the user, and which should cause changes on the user's side. How to get it to wait for that?
  -Lots of documentation on how /not/ to do that. Basically fucking nothing on how /to/ do it

New Features
-Host should maybe receive messages with a list of who has received them
-I think I want timestamps on messages
-A "credits" page which lists what happened to each player

TO ASK ALEX
-Should disconnected players be able to see conversations?
  -I think: they shouldn't, but they should be able too once the game is over
