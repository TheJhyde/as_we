Scenarios the IDs should handle (the last order_num is 0 in all cases)

The standard one:
  A sends a message. It is assigned the id 1
  A and B receives the message, with it's id
  B sends a message, with the id 2
Same Time
  A sends a message
  B sends a message, before A's message is received
  Desired Outcome: Both messages get the same ID, it doesn't matter how they're sorted, the next message is 2
Too Fast
  A sends a message
  A sends another message before the first message is received back
  Desired Outcome: The first message gets 1, the second 2, they are shown in order
Out of Order
  A sends a message, then another message
  B receives the second message first, then the first message
  Desired Outcome: They are sorted on the screen in correct order

Big Picture:
-Back button problem
-Mark phone numbers

Big Styling Overhaul
-Weird inconsistency with text size
  On the phone, if there are any messages longer than 10 characters, all of the messages will appear in a larger font
  Triggers the effect: '12345678901', '12345 7890' 'the the the the'
  Doesn't: 'it's very weird', 'the the the'
  See if I can replicate it locally, ideally in the browser
-If the chat box is shorter than it's maximum size, when the keyboard comes up you can't see the bottom of the chat window
-I still don't like the way the notification colors are working on the player page
-Timestamps with javascript? Does that make sense?

DOING IT PROPERLY
-Optimizing the database requests
-Upping the Accessibility
-Test performance generally
-What kind of backend am I using to run the jobs?
-Firefox seems finicky with channels
  -I can build this with ajax calls. But I'd have to 1. do it and 2. detect the failure to connect to the channel and switch over to ajax styles
-Convert to vanilla javascript
-100% test coverage

-Tests for channels
  -It does appear there are testing utilities for channels. Not sure if there's much in the way of documentation though
-Javascript testing
  -So far, this is a nightmare. System testings are intended to simulate running through the system as on a browser, javascript and all
  -But I can't figure out how to get it to wait for things to happen. I'm looking at events which are triggered by server, with no input from the user, and which should cause changes on the user's side. How to get it to wait for that?
  -Lots of documentation on how /not/ to do that. Basically fucking nothing on how /to/ do it

New Features
-Host should maybe receive messages with a list of who has received them
-A "credits" page which lists what happened to each player

TO ASK ALEX
-Should disconnected players be able to see conversations?
  -I think: they shouldn't, but they should be able too once the game is over
  -I should be able to see conversations, even if the players can't
