Big Picture:
-Write controller tests
-How to test channels? 
-Firefox seems finicky with channels
  -I can build this with ajax calls. But I'd have to 1. do it and 2. detect the failure to connect to the channel and switch over to ajax styles

Host Page 
  -Game timer
  -List of news updates, posted and to come
  -Mark on the host page with who's left, in javascript through host channels

Edit Player Page
  -I'd like to cache the options, so they persist for each player at least ~five minutes. Or even like 30 seconds. Discouraging reloading until you get what you want

Conversation Page
  -Is HRN not receiving it's own messages in the chat when they're sent?
  -Not sure if notification button is updating correctly
    -Sender of the message gets notifications sometimes?
  -Players shouldn't be able to see conversations they're not a part of
    -But, maybe hosts should be able too?

TO ASK ALEX
-Should there be some kind of limit on how players leaving? A gap of time between attempts?
-Should disconnected players be able to see conversations?




TO DO BUT NOT RIGHT NOW, THIS STUFF DOESN'T MATTER RIGHT NOW
-The link text is different in from messages vs too messages, which bothers me. It should be consistent, lest the players read into it
-There's a lot of empty space at the bottom of the conversation screen. should probably do something about that
-I think I want timestamps on messages
-When game starts, a "Connected!" message that disappears after a little bit
-"Return to Front Page" link when game's over on game, player maybe?
-Order of conversations - I'd like HRN to be on top all the time
-Should there be some additional message at the end of the game?
  -Should players forced to leave by the end of the game get too choose left options? Probably
