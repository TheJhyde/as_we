Big Picture:
-After changing the message thing, I have to make sure I didn't break anything else
-So now's probably the time to bite the bullet and write some tests

-ActionCable seems kind of unreliable?

Root Page
  -What if someone loses their session or cookies somehow? There should be a login method by name
  -Initial Styling

Host Page 
  -Game timer
  -How does the host get their connections to players?
    -Use the player list
  -Initial Styling

Player Page
  -When a player leaves
    -Sending a message to their conversation partners - "#{number} has disconnected"
    -Giving the player themselves their fate
    -Preventing a player who's left from sending any messages
      -(You can send messages to players who've left. That's poigent, yo)
  -Like... any security
  -Test styling for end of game

Conversation Page
  -Host should have two rows of notifications
  -Scroll down to the bottom on page load, when a message is sent

TO ASK ALEX
-I'm giving each of the players a five number code - that good? Should it be more like a phone number, 10 digits?
-Does the host need or want the ability to read everyone's messages?
-Should I restrict the host's ability to talk to people without getting their numbers?
-Do we want to save the messages for later review?

Styling

Player Page:
  -Connecting... message, with an animation during pre-game
  -Disconnected, during post game
