Big Picture:
-How to test channels? 
-Firefox seems finicky with channels
  -I can build this with ajax calls. But I'd have to 1. do it and 2. detect the failure to connect to the channel and switch over to ajax styles
-Do another big test of the notification systems online, running through a whole game
-Channel tests?
-Job tests?
-There's all this javascript and I'd love to be able to test it somehow. That's what I'm most concerned about breaking somehow
-Big styling overhaul

Host Page 
  -List of news updates, posted and to come
    -For this I'd need to get a list of activejobs, somehow. A real mystery
    -Maybe not necessary?

TO ASK ALEX
-Should there be some kind of limit on how players leaving? A gap of time between attempts?
-Should disconnected players be able to see conversations?
-Should players forced to leave by the end of the game get too choose left options? Probably



TO DO BUT NOT RIGHT NOW, THIS STUFF DOESN'T MATTER RIGHT NOW
-The link text is different in from messages vs too messages, which bothers me. It should be consistent, lest the players read into it
-There's a lot of empty space at the bottom of the conversation screen. should probably do something about that
-I think I want timestamps on messages
-When game starts, a "Connected!" message that disappears after a little bit
-"Return to Front Page" link when game's over on game, player maybe?
-Order of conversations - I'd like HRN to be on top all the time

DOING IT PROPERLY
-Optimizing the database requests
-Tests for channels
-Test for jobs
-Upping the Accessibility
-Test performance generally
-What kind of backend am I using to run the jobs?
