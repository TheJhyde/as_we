Big Picture:
-How to test channels? 
-Firefox seems finicky with channels
  -I can build this with ajax calls. But I'd have to 1. do it and 2. detect the failure to connect to the channel and switch over to ajax styles

When I closed the brower, I lost all the cookies, everything. That's terrible
  -Ideally I could fix this
  -Failing that, I should bite the bullet and make the login page

-Text is too small on mobile, should be much bigger
    -The styling I've already done is successfully uploaded - what kind of dimensions am I dealing with here?
    -I kind of want some kind of scaling font size
  The font inside HRN's conversations, any only HRN's conversations, is a good size. Everything else is just absolute garbage. Why the difference?
  The header is unusable, much too small to use the back button
  When I click on the font box, it zooms in on just the box, so I have to move to hit the submit button.
    And then I'm zoomed in at a weird way
Can't submit from the keyboard on mobile in the text area. Should use text box instead maybe

Root page
  -What if someone loses their session or cookies somehow? There should be a login method by name

Host Page 
  -Game timer
  -List of news updates, posted and to come

Player Page
  -Like... any security
    -Non-hosts shouldn't be able to see the game
    -players should only be able to see their own player page
    -Players shouldn't be able to see conversations they're not a part of
  -When game starts, a "Connected!" message that disappears after a little bit
  -When a player leaves
    -Sending a message to their conversation partners - "#{number} has disconnected"
    -Giving the player themselves their fate
    -Preventing a player who's left from sending any messages
      -(You can send messages to players who've left. That's poigent, yo)

Conversation Page
  -Add "DISCONNECTED" or "LEFT" message to the conversation page when the game is over.
    -Roll this into the leaving system
  -Is HRN not receiving it's own messages in the chat when they're sent?
  -Not sure if notification button is updating correctly
    -Even numbered notifications turn the notification back off again, which is wrong obvs
    -Sender of the message gets notifications sometimes?
  -I think I want timestamps on messages

TO ASK ALEX
-I'm giving each of the players a five number code - that good? Should it be more like a phone number, 10 digits?
-Does the host need or want the ability to read everyone's messages?
-Should I restrict the host's ability to talk to people without getting their numbers?
-Do we want to save the messages for later review?






TO DO BUT NOT RIGHT NOW, THIS STUFF DOESN'T MATTER RIGHT NOW
-The link text is different in from messages vs too messages, which bothers me. It should be consistent, lest the players read into it
-There's a lot of empty space at the bottom of the conversation screen. should probably do something about that
