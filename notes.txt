Big Picture:
-How to test channels? 
-Firefox seems finicky with channels
  -I can build this with ajax calls. But I'd have to 1. do it and 2. detect the failure to connect to the channel and switch over to ajax styles

Root page
  -What if someone loses their session or cookies somehow? There should be a login method by name

Host Page 
  -Game timer
  -List of news updates, posted and to come

Player Page
  -Like... any security
    -Non-hosts shouldn't be able to see the game
    -players should only be able to see their own player page
    -Players shouldn't be able to see conversations they're not a part of
  -When game starts, a "Connected!" message that disappears after a little bit
  -When a player leaves
    -Sending a message to their conversation partners - "#{number} has disconnected"
    -Giving the player themselves their fate
    -Preventing a player who's left from sending any messages
      -(You can send messages to players who've left. That's poigent, yo)

Conversation Page
  -Add "DISCONNECTED" or "LEFT" message to the conversation page when the game is over.
    -Roll this into the leaving system
  -Is HRN not receiving it's own messages in the chat when they're sent?

TO ASK ALEX
-I'm giving each of the players a five number code - that good? Should it be more like a phone number, 10 digits?
-Does the host need or want the ability to read everyone's messages?
-Should I restrict the host's ability to talk to people without getting their numbers?
-Do we want to save the messages for later review?






TO DO BUT NOT RIGHT NOW, THIS STUFF DOESN'T MATTER RIGHT NOW
-The link text is different in from messages vs too messages, which bothers me. It should be consistent, lest the players read into it
-There's a lot of empty space at the bottom of the conversation screen. should probably do something about that
