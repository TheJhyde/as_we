Scenarios the IDs should handle (the last order_num is 0 in all cases)

Big Picture:
-Back button problem
-Mark phone numbers
-Could I broadcast incoming messages before they're saved in the database? That might speed up the process a bit, help avoid order problems
  Have to do it after I've validated it, so incorrect messages don't slip through
  I made that update, test it before going live

Big Styling Overhaul
-Weird inconsistency with text size
  On the phone, if there are any messages longer than 10 characters, all of the messages will appear in a larger font
  Triggers the effect: '12345678901', '12345 7890' 'the the the the'
  Doesn't: 'it's very weird', 'the the the'
  See if I can replicate it locally, ideally in the browser
-If the chat box is shorter than it's maximum size, when the keyboard comes up you can't see the bottom of the chat window

DOING IT PROPERLY
-Optimizing the database requests
-Upping the Accessibility
-Test performance generally
-What kind of backend am I using to run the jobs?
-Firefox seems finicky with channels
  -I can build this with ajax calls. But I'd have to 1. do it and 2. detect the failure to connect to the channel and switch over to ajax styles
-Convert to vanilla javascript
-100% test coverage

-Tests for channels
  -It does appear there are testing utilities for channels. Not sure if there's much in the way of documentation though
-Javascript testing
  -So far, this is a nightmare. System testings are intended to simulate running through the system as on a browser, javascript and all
  -But I can't figure out how to get it to wait for things to happen. I'm looking at events which are triggered by server, with no input from the user, and which should cause changes on the user's side. How to get it to wait for that?
  -Lots of documentation on how /not/ to do that. Basically fucking nothing on how /to/ do it

New Features
-Host should maybe receive messages with a list of who has received them
-A "credits" page which lists what happened to each player

TO ASK ALEX
-Should disconnected players be able to see conversations?
  -I think: they shouldn't, but they should be able too once the game is over
  -I should be able to see conversations, even if the players can't
