Big Picture:
-Back button problem
-Big styling overhaul

Host Page 
  -List of news updates, posted and to come
    -Probably best to revise how updates are done entirely in that case, put them in the database in some fashion
    -And then the host could potentially update them before the game starts! That'd be neato.

-It's nice to have something to signal when HRN sends message to people
  -But the unread notification shouldn't be used to signal that - the host needs know if a player is trying to contact them through HRN
  -When the javascript detects a HRN to Host message, that shouldn't be marked as "unread"

A "credits" page which lists what happened to each player

TO ASK ALEX
-Should disconnected players be able to see conversations?
  -I think: they shouldn't, but they should be able too once the game is over
-Should players forced to leave at the end of the game and get too choose left options
  -Yes, I think they should


TO DO BUT NOT RIGHT NOW, THIS STUFF DOESN'T MATTER RIGHT NOW
-Maybe make the cut-off for the mobile styling a little smaller
-The link text is different in from messages vs too messages, which bothers me. It should be consistent, lest the players read into it
-There's a lot of empty space at the bottom of the conversation screen. should probably do something about that
-I think I want timestamps on messages
-When game starts, a "Connected!" message that disappears after a little bit
-"Return to Front Page" link when game's over on game, player maybe?
-Order of conversations - I'd like HRN to be on top all the time. Or at the very least, for it to be consistent
-Weird inconsistency with text size
  On the phone, if there are any messages longer than 10 characters, all of the messages will appear in a larger font
  Triggers the effect: '12345678901', '12345 7890' 'the the the the'
  Doesn't: 'it's very weird', 'the the the'
  See if I can replicate it locally, ideally in the browser
-If the chat box is shorter than it's maximum size, when the keyboard comes up you can't see the bottom of the chat window

DOING IT PROPERLY
-Tests for channels
-Javascript testing
-Optimizing the database requests
-Test for jobs
-Upping the Accessibility
-Test performance generally
-What kind of backend am I using to run the jobs?
-Firefox seems finicky with channels
  -I can build this with ajax calls. But I'd have to 1. do it and 2. detect the failure to connect to the channel and switch over to ajax styles
-Convert to vanilla javascript
