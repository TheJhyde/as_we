Big Picture:
-start_time isn't being set properly by the start
-fate and change also aren't being set correctly. Problem with the migration?
-Weird inconsistency with text size
  On the phone, if there are any messages longer than 10 characters, all of the messages will appear in a larger font
  Triggers the effect: '12345678901', '12345 7890' 'the the the the'
  Doesn't: 'it's very weird', 'the the the'
  See if I can replicate it locally, ideally in the browser
-If the chat box is shorter than it's maximum size, when the keyboard comes up you can't see the bottom of the chat window
-back button problem

-Firefox seems finicky with channels
  -I can build this with ajax calls. But I'd have to 1. do it and 2. detect the failure to connect to the channel and switch over to ajax styles
-Big styling overhaul

Host Page 
  -List of news updates, posted and to come
    -For this I'd need to get a list of activejobs, somehow. A real mystery
    -Maybe not necessary?

-It's nice to have something to signal when HRN sends message to people
  -But the unread notification shouldn't be used to signal that - the host needs know if a player is trying to contact them through HRN
  -When the javascript detects a HRN to Host message, that shouldn't be marked as "unread"

TO ASK ALEX
-Should there be some kind of limit on how players leaving? A gap of time between attempts?
-Should disconnected players be able to see conversations?
-Should players forced to leave by the end of the game get too choose left options? Probably



TO DO BUT NOT RIGHT NOW, THIS STUFF DOESN'T MATTER RIGHT NOW
-Maybe make the cut-off for the mobile styling a little smaller
-The link text is different in from messages vs too messages, which bothers me. It should be consistent, lest the players read into it
-There's a lot of empty space at the bottom of the conversation screen. should probably do something about that
-I think I want timestamps on messages
-When game starts, a "Connected!" message that disappears after a little bit
-"Return to Front Page" link when game's over on game, player maybe?
-Order of conversations - I'd like HRN to be on top all the time. Or at the very least, for it to be consistent

DOING IT PROPERLY
-Tests for channels
-Javascript testing
-Optimizing the database requests
-Test for jobs
-Upping the Accessibility
-Test performance generally
-What kind of backend am I using to run the jobs?
